### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1 was my favorite as it was one of the first labs that I had completed. The experience of being in my first Computer Science
class along with trying to get familiar with coding is a memory I'll never forget. I was able to use what I had learned in my 
lecture while also referring to my notes and communicating with my group.

* Lab 3

Lab 3 was also another one of my favorite labs, as I started learning both input and output variables. Part one was more straightforward,
as part two was more difficult for me. Although I specifically remember this lab as it required a lot more questions that needed to be 
answered, but finally came together in the end. 

* Lab 10 

Lab 10 was another one of my favorites. It focused on both functions and vectors and was a lot more tedious. I also enjoyed how
it was only 1 part, however, part one was a little longer and took longer than expected. Overall, Lab 10 was my absolute favorite because
it challenged me quite well.
